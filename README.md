# ACF Sites Field

### Description

Adds a 'ACF Sites' field type for the [Advanced Custom Fields](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/advanced-custom-fields/) WordPress plugin.

This field type gives the user the option to choose from displaying sites as a drop down or as checkboxes (to allow for multiple selections). These sites IDs are then saved and can be retrieved for any kind of use. You might use this to have an ads post type which can be set to be displayed on a single or multiple sites in a network.. just as an example!

* ACF 5
* ACF 4

### Installation

1. Copy the `acf-sites` folder into your `wp-content/plugins` folder
2. Activate the Sites plugin via the plugins admin page
3. Create a new field via ACF and select the Sites type
